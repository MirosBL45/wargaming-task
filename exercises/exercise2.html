        <li>The second takes longer to load, it is worsening</li>
        <li>On the first in section Captains! says: Due to the installation of the Update, the server will be unavailable, on the second, it says: While the new update is being rolled out, the server will be down (without colon). Also in the first one says Update size of 4.7 GB. It is better on the first</li>
        <li>On the second immediately below section Captains! has list of new features, it's an improvement</li>
        <li>On the second below Youtube video it has cool paragraph about gift on the page, it's an improvement</li>
        <li>On the second, the games are "collected" and then you expand only the one that interests you, you don't have to scroll through all the texts in order to get to what you want. Because here you only see titles, not the entire text of what you are not interested in, it's an improvement</li>
        <li>As for Expand and Collapse, it would be better if that Collapse while scrolling is Fixed on Top so when you finish reading that part, you can immediately click on Collapse and then Expand to continue reading the next card that interests you. Because of this way you have 2 options, to scroll back up to reach Collapse, or to expand more cards and then the article is taken meters down and you get lost in a lot of text</li>
        <li>At the bottom of both pages in section Other Changes, the first one has text, it is not in the form like the games were, and the second one is in the form of a card, as the games are also in such cards. But on the second one, when you open Other Changes, the entire text falls out at once, and it is more difficult to find the text that interests you. On the first one, you can open part by part only the title that interests you</li>
        <li>On the second, the host on the Youtube channel has a nicer hairstyle &#128513;</li>
