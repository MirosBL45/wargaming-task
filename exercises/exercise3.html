        <li>At resolutin 1024px button PLAY FOR FREE is out of the frame!</li>
        <li>Headline Ready for Battle? Is too small and poorly visible because of the background image, maybe color hex: FFFFFF</li>
        <li>Link System requiremnts is small and poorly visible because of the background image, because of the fire in the picture, maybe bold</li>
        <li>Background image should have transparent cover, maybe hex: 6B6B6B with 30% transparency</li>
        <li>The icons below the ships are large, maybe 73x49 (changed in Cruisers section to see the difference)</li>
        <li>Warship Types – Battleships boat is too big</li>
        <li>Gallery of Epic Battles – text under is to close to pictures</li>
        <li>Buttons maybe corner radius 20</li>
        <li>Download game letter spacing 8.5%</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="improvement">The expected improvement effect is better readability of the site, therefore easier for users to use. Because the rounded edges concentrate users' attention into the button outline and make the buttons feel easier to push, they have a friendlier tone and can assist users focus on the key information inside. However, buttons with sharp rectangular edges that point away from the content, direct attention to the outside of the button.</p>
